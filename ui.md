# ToastMan UI Improvements & Fixes

## Current Issues & Required Features

### 1. Collections Tab Issues

#### Missing Interactions
- **No context menu for collections**: Currently collections display but have no interaction options
- **Required actions needed**:
  - Rename Collection
  - Delete Collection
  - Create Request (in collection)
  - Duplicate Collection
  - Import/Export Collection

#### Implementation Plan
- Add right-click context menu to collection headers
- Add dropdown menu button (â‹®) to each collection
- Create CollectionContextMenu component

---

### 2. Global Request Creation System

#### Current Problem
- No unified way to create requests across the app
- Need builder pattern for request creation
- Requests should automatically create new tabs

#### Required Features
- **Global request builder**: Accessible from anywhere in the app
- **New tab creation**: Each new request opens in a new tab
- **Request template system**: Pre-configured request types (GET, POST, etc.)
- **Collection assignment**: Ability to assign request to a collection during creation

#### Implementation Plan
- Create `CreateRequestDialog` component
- Create `RequestBuilder` service/composable
- Integrate with tabs system for automatic tab creation
- Add global + button or keyboard shortcut

---

### 3. Request Tabs Issues

#### Current Problems
- **New Tab shows "loading"**: Should show proper new tab interface
- **+ button not working**: Cannot create new tabs
- **No empty tab state**: Missing proper empty/new tab template

#### Required Features
- Proper new tab interface with request builder
- Working + button functionality
- Default request template in new tabs
- Tab management (close, rename, duplicate)

#### Implementation Plan
- Fix NewTab component to show request builder instead of loading
- Connect + button to tab creation logic
- Create proper empty tab state with request form

---

### 4. Environments Tab Issues

#### Current Problems
- **+ button not working**: Cannot create new environments
- **No add environment dialog**: Missing environment creation UI
- **No active environment indicator**: Cannot see which environment is active
- **No way to activate environment**: Missing activation mechanism

#### Required Features
- Create Environment dialog
- Environment activation/deactivation
- Active environment indicator in UI
- Environment management (edit, delete, duplicate)
- Variable management within environments

#### Implementation Plan
- Create `NewEnvironmentDialog` component
- Add environment activation logic
- Create environment context menu
- Add active environment indicator to UI header
